# Security Guidelines

## Vulnerability Reporting

## Best Practices for Handling Full Device Permissions

1. **Limit Permissions**: Always request only the permissions necessary for your application to function. Avoid requesting full device permissions unless absolutely required.
   
2. **User Transparency**: Clearly inform users why certain permissions are needed and how they will enhance their experience.
   
3. **Regular Audits**: Regularly review and audit the permissions your application requests to ensure they remain relevant and necessary.
   
4. **Use Proven Libraries**: Leverage established libraries and frameworks when dealing with sensitive permissions, such as location and contacts.

5. **User Control**: Provide users the ability to revoke permissions easily within the application settings.
   
6. **Security Updates**: Keep your application updated with the latest security patches and use secure coding practices to protect against vulnerabilities.
   
7. **Testing**: Conduct regular security testing, including code reviews and vulnerability assessments, to identify and mitigate potential security risks.

## Conclusion
Following these guidelines will help us maintain a safe and secure application for our users. Thank you for your commitment to security!
